			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p> There were various issues caused by firearms. First of all it was dangerous and United States allowed citizens to possess it for self-defense. In my hometown, Taiwan, firearms were illegal. Having firearms would mean imprisonment for many years. That was why I was shocked when I first moved here to the United States. I did not get the concept of having firearms for self-protection. I know in some areas, crime rates are really high, however that does not mean that citizens should have firearms. There are other ways to protect citizens other than just giving them firearms and telling them to protect themselves. There are various methods that we could use to ensure our country a safe place to live. There are police forces that we can utilize to settle certain areas of the country. The large issue I have with firearms was that any citizen could possess them. There have been many news about getting hurt with gunfire among citizens around United States. Recently there was a shooting at Purdue University. It was known that the suspects went in and randomly shot people. How do these people get their firearms? United States allows people to have firearms. We will never know when someone would go insane and start shooting at people randomly. That was why I am very negative toward people having firearms. It's very dangerous for citizens to have because one can never predict what will happen in the future. What if one day the gun holder could become a serial killer? There are things that we need to watch out for. Just a few days later, Michigan State University shooting erupted. There were people shot in cedar village because of drug issues. No one would've been dead if there were no firearms all over the place. </p>
