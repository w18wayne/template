			<h1>First reason</h1>
		<p>First, the communication skill that waiters have is a special asset that waiters have. These communication skills differ from restaurant to restaurant. It all depends on how the restaurant is run by the superiors. There is generally two ways that I have seen ever since I have been to Michigan. The two examples that I am going to use are Hong Kong Restaurant and Buffalo Wild Wings. Generally because I had some difficulties at Buffalo Wild Wings which I did not have at Hong Kong Restaurant that made me understand the different type of operations of for waiters. There was once where we had too many people walking into Buffalo Wild wings and therefore we had to split tables, however due to one person paying for it all, we could not have done that. For American restaurants, most of them are table assigned to Waiters. Each waiter has their own table and they deserve the tip that they will earn because everything is done by them. However in Hong Kong Restaurant things are a little bit different. They didn’t care which tables we sat at and if we are paying one bill because the tips are shared. In Hong Kong Restaurant one of the communication skills they can use is asking for help. (Study Express) Asking for help is one of the essential skills for waiters. I do not think a waiter can handle everything by oneself. They sometimes need help for people to grab drinks for them and serve food for them while they have to serve other tables. Other parts of the communication skill include “giving and receiving instructions, negotiating and persuading effectively, sharing information, speaking clearly and directly, and listening and understanding.” (Study Express) giving and receiving instructions occurs when the waiter has to talk with the chef. My friend Daniel says “The communication between the waiter and chef is essential. There are things that a waiter must tell the chef specifically. I work at Hong Kong Restaurant, and if the customers did not want to add something like green onions we specifically tell the chef. Also we need to communicate clearly with the chef to produce the best quality of food close to the desire of the customer.” (Daniel Sun) The negotiation and persuading effectively can be explained by everyone’s personally experience. We would walk into a new restaurant not knowing what to eat, however there is the waiter explaining to us which dish he prefers and why. What is the ingredient and why we would want to want this dish. This is a very important skill of a waiter as well. Sharing information is seen often as well. At Hong Kong restaurant I see the waiter talking to each other. There is generally one person grabbing all the drinks, one person ordering all the food and then they both serve the food and clean tables. That is because they shared the information with each other and that is an important skill that waiters should have. There are various ways to run a restaurant and waiters are living based off those various ways. An excellent communication waiter could really help himself and others around him. That is why communication skills are one of the most important skills for a waiter. However there are other skills besides communication. </p></article>
