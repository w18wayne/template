			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>In Taiwan, even some rookie police officers don't have the right to have firearms. Firearms are dangerous objects and Taiwan is really strict on that. If there is no need for firearms to solve problems, police generally don't pull them out at all. </p>
                 	<p>I think another issue with firearm and the difference between Taiwan and United States is the ability to be educated on firearms. I studied my elementary and middle school in Taiwan, however we were never in contact with any firearm. I actually did not have any knowledge of firearm until I came to the United States. I know police have firearms to help citizens when needed. However I have never seen a real firearm, except of those in movies. However United States is different, they have firearms knowledge in lots of places. Also they have military schools, more than Taiwan. There are many places that one can get knowledge about fire arms in the United States and also there are so many games associated with fire arms that are popular in the United States.
