			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>In conclusion, firearms are dangerous and should not be entrusted to citizens. These weapons are dangerous and life threatening to innocent people. Although some people might not agree with the solutions that I have posted, I think that those are the most viable solutions that I can think that would cost the least harm to society and help society the most. Of course there are many other solutions, however the solutions I have posted is the fastest solution that would help. However I do not thinking banning out one of commandments is viable. United States wants to be different from others and that could have a positive effect but could also could go the other way. I really think with our society right now, in some areas there is no need to bare firearms. That will just help the crime rate increase. There needs to be more solution that could be posted to help the society. Although as a society United States have agreed to have the right to bare fire arms, but there are people that disagree with this idea as well. There could be a huge debate on whether citizens need to keep firearms. In my point of view there is basically no need for any citizens to have firearms for anything. This will definitely decrease the crime rate and also decrease the deaths and injuries of innocents. There system isn't perfect and there are still many parts of the system that could be fixed. I hope one day all these issues could really be resolved because it is mournful to hear deaths and injuries due to shootings over the news. There will be things done about this issue and hopefully will make this world a better place. </p>
