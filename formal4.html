			<h1>other skill</h1>
			<p>Another skill that waiter’s should have is stress management. (Work) The reason stress management is important is due to the fact that many times when a restaurant is full there will noisy conversations everywhere and waiters have to bust through every table to get their food order, drink order and then after all that they have to serve the food. (Work) This could really start to wear down a waiter because at all these times one is probably spending a lot of time thinking what to do next, and running all over the place to get tasks accomplished. (work) If one can’t handle the stress that the work is going to bring upon, then they probably aren’t suitable for waiters. As waiters I don’t like them to be slow. If I see food being delivered out already and no waiter has been grabbing the food for the other tables which is disrupting the food chain to my table, I will get mad. Waiters are generally expected to be working in a really fast pace working environment. This fast pace environment could be hard to handle. “It is tough, really tough. Sometimes when the restaurants full and you have about three more tables waiting outside we really have to bust through every table really fast. Sometimes it’s okay because they come in at different times. However when they all come in at once, it could potentially become a nightmare. We order all at once and it becomes really hard for the chefs to pump out the food. And customers start complaining because they haven’t got their food for the past twenty minutes. However there really isn’t much we can do because we can’t control the speed that chef produced the food. It becomes a very tough position after awhile and I think this starts to bring a lot of stress and a burden for the waiter. It gets tiring after awhile, and customers start complaining at you, but we still need to keep that smile on the face.” (Daniel Sun) As we can see there is a lot of stress in my friend’s waiter’s life. Busting tables isn’t easy especially when people have no patience. Maybe it is due to the culture of the Chinese background; many people do not have the patience and think customers are the largest. However I think this ideal will need to be changed.</p> 
	<p>Other skill sets are people oriented, quick thinker, knowledgeable. (work) The idea of quick thinker comes from that when emergencies happens, such as the case when waters are spilled, or when the customers are having issues. We will need fast solutions. Waiters need to think of a solution that would solve the problem in the shortest amount of time. For example if water is spilled one will need to clean the water spill really fast. There are many things that could occur during a waiter’s day and he needs to think of solution really fast to solve it. Knowledgeable is another key asset that waiters may have. “Sometimes there are people that come in and just tell us they are Muslim, or Buddhist and things like that. Their religious belief is an important knowledge that waiters should have. Some things such as Buddhist don’t eat meat, and Muslims don’t eat pork and Indians generally don’t eat beef. These are the things that could really help a waiter excel in his own working conditions. “ (Daniel Sun) As we can see being knowledgeable in some things could really help a waiter. For example if I had a belief and Buddhism and the waiter offered me all meat dishes I would be mad. There are things like that waiters would need to watch out for or it would be hard for them to get tipped well. Tipping is an art form, and thus how much does waiters make generally?</p>
