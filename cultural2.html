			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Throughout history, wars had erupted many times and through all these wars technology has continuously evolved and developed from time to time. Guns have become more and more advance and with limited range before, guns developed into long range snipers and shot guns. There is a development of different gunfire. Modern day technology has improved so much compared to the past. Right now the power of gunfire cannot be underestimated as it has good precision and strength. I know that thinking that the world could be a peaceful place is merely impossible because there will always be different opinions. Some people accept different opinions from different types of people. However some like to be leaders and obliterate all other options with force. In my hometown, Taiwan, gunfire are not allowed. They are forbidden for normal citizens to possess. The United States have legalized their citizens to buy the gunfire at their free will with some identification and registration. This could cause much tragedy as we've already seen many times on the news. There have been several tragedies for the time I have been here in the States. These tragedies include shooting in elementary schools and universities to colleges and society. These acts wouldn't have happened if gunfire were not legalized in the United States. Thus I think that gunfire has had a tremendous negative effect on the society of United States and overall around the globe. </p>
