			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>	In conclusion, waiter is a very tough job. Their income depends on other people’s gratuity towards them and they have such a hard working ethic and also a very well rounded skill set, yet they are seemed as one of the most less respected jobs globally. They put a lot of hard work into providing so much for the customer and sometimes the customer might appreciate it and sometimes the customers might not appreciate it. However whatever they are trying to do is always to help the customer. They mean no offense for the customer and I think many people should learn to tip waiters, especially those of us that come from Asia. I know it is not a habit however giving good tips could really help waiters pass a long day and also keep that excellent service going on. Throughout this essay I keep stressing the fact that waiters had different type of skill sets. They had various skill sets to keep them in the position they are in. Not all waiters work for money and thus don’t judge people just because they are a waiter. They are there to help you and serve you but they aren’t slaves. Lastly I would like to leave a part for people to think about, this is what my friend Daniel told me what he sees at his restaurant. I think some of the habit that Asian kids could be changed. “Every day when I first walk into the restaurant it would start out a bit slow, because I generally arrive at 4PM. However it would get heavier and heavier as time progresses. Especially when it hit the 7PM it would be packed full. There are times where I don’t know I’m a waiter or a slave. I am trying to help other customers, and these Chinese kids would always be yelling at waiters because they needed water or something else. This really makes me mad because I already saw them raising their hands about 10 seconds ago and they saw me looking at them. All other waiters are busy and it is ridiculous if they can’t even wait for one minute before we have time for them.” (Daniel Sun) Some kids really need to change their attitude towards waiters. They are waiters not slaves. I hope people can understand the hard ship of waiters and start learning to tip properly and remember that they are waiters. </p>
