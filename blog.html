		        <p>This week are targeted in the computer game, people that have the experience can be most reference.people will just go online to communicate with people, and not go out. This is an inherent problem with our generation, and is making a lot of us socially innept. The creators are making fun of a very large issue in society, and they aren't approaching it very seriously. The point of south park is to do that, so I can't really blame them. The should have taken a more mild approach, and talked about how this issue is widespread, and needs to be fixed.</p>

			<h1>Blog #4</h1>
			<p>This is the first day of the wra class. Our first project was life experience. my writing skill was not very good, so i always use lot of friend comments during the writing. The most hard things was using the blog. this is my first time using the blog. I am very interesting to have the new experience.</p>
			<h1>Blog #5</h1>
			<p>In this week, We are finish our life experience project. In this project I write about the cellphone in th human life. My project is about Communication is the most efficient way to improve the world. Communication let people to control the world economic. Why can communication control the world? In the year 1973, Martin Cooper invented the mobile phone. During that time, sharing information was not an easy task and it took a long period of time. As cellphones became more and more popularize, it made the world a better and more efficiency place. Nowadays, cellphone become the fundamental need to every job.</p>
			<h1>Blog #6</h1>
			<p>In this week, We are doing our new project curtural affect.the analysis of a cultural artifact, to reconnoiter a social conflict, also how the conflict is significance on society. There are many cultural artifact that can be discuss, such as a video game, a music video, a movie, and a TV show. I chose how video game can influence many teenagers are obsessed with playing video games. They play twenty-four hours a days, never getting any rest.</p>
			<h1>Blog #7</h1>
			<p>This week was the final deadline of the cultural artifact. In this project, I write about Throughout history, wars had erupted many times and through all these wars technology has continuously evolved and developed from time to time. Guns have become more and more advance and with limited range before, guns developed into long range snipers and shot guns. There is a development of different gunfire. Modern day technology has improved so much compared to the past. Right now the power of gunfire cannot be underestimated as it has good precision and strength. I know that thinking that the world could be a peaceful place is merely impossible because there will always be different opinions. Some people accept different opinions from different types of people. However some like to be leaders and obliterate all other options with force. In my hometown, Taiwan, gunfire are not allowed. They are forbidden for normal citizens to possess. The United States have legalized their citizens to buy the gunfire at their free will with some identification and registration. This could cause much tragedy as we've already seen many times on the news. There have been several tragedies for the time I have been here in the States. These tragedies include shooting in elementary schools and universities to colleges and society. These acts wouldn't have happened if gunfire were not legalized in the United States. Thus I think that gunfire has had a tremendous negative effect on the society of United States and overall around the globe. </p>

			<h1>Blog #14</h1>
			<p>Throughout this semester there has been many papers that had been written and throughout those papers I learned a lot personally. The first paper I wrote was about communications. The second paper I wrote was about gunfire and the third piece I wrote was about the job of waiters. Finally we made a video about gaming violence as our last project. This course has taught a great deal about writing and has also taught a great deal of various different things. Within each assignment it has taught more than what we would have learned in other classes because every topic is interesting. Every topic is depended upon personal choices and what one believes in. One has been getting better and better with writing as well throughout this course. due to one's freedom of topic to write it has become a very easy course and very pleasant one as well. I will show you through the examples of my paper. </p>
