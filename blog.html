			<p>Moreover, we were also introduced to our first project, which is the Lived Experiences Project. This project serves as an easy start for us since it only wants us to write about our personal experience in an anecdote leads to the pursuing of our current major. I think the instructions was pretty straightforward and I already have brainstormed my idea so that it would be easier for me when I start to work on it. </p>

			<bout that I was in Electrical engineering and swirch out to usiness in my second in Michigan State University. The toughness part for this project is that I have to finish a 1200 word essay. Which is a huge amount of words for me to describe the a experience and how technology inflence my decision to switch out my major. At the end, we need to provide a web version of our projects. The web making sources “Github” is using the fundamental HTML and CSS language to make the web page, that was quite a challenge for me to figure the method to finish my first web page.</p>

			<p>This week I am starting the second porject which is cultural amalysis proposal. The purpose for this project is through the analysis of a cultural artifact, to reconnoiter a social conflict, also how the conflict is significance on society. There are many cultural artifact that can be discuss, such as a video game, a music video, a movie, and a TV show. I chose how video game can influence many teenagers are obsessed with playing video games. They play twenty-four hours a days, never getting any rest. After that, Teenagers started to get un healthy and mess up their life. the social issue growing up larger in scope every day, also has become a common and serious problem for most of American family. Here are the idea I come out for this week, I think I can come out the soloution and conclusion for the next week. I also woking the codeacademy, which is interesting website and activtiy I can do for this course. I think the course will getting harder and challanger more next few week, but I am excited I can learn more new stuff for the course is going on.</p>
			<h1>Blog #8</h1>
			<p>This week I research for my culture analysis proposal solution and the conclusion for my project, I came out two solutions, which can help teenager to stay away from the video game, conclude my suggestions specifically is targeting gamers that stay at home and just do nothing all day but play games. Due to the fact that this has not only not improved their life but have made it worse. That is why I think games should be set to certain ages and certain groups of people. At the end, I think Video gaming has been a culture or human and hope teenager wont be obsessed on it for every moment, and become a more successful person. This project require large amount of word to develop the our point of view, which is 1800 word court for the minimum. Not similar to the previous project is that we need to find source how this culture artifact going to influence society, that was a different experiment for me to write a paper like this one. For this project require web version and use “Github” as a web page development website to finish my web pages. In this project, I need to have different template to display different part of my proposal that was have large difference with the previous one. We need to type out some HTML language to finish this web page.</p>
			<h1>Blog #9</h1>
			<p>This week we got a first formal research paper, when I got this instruction, I think I need to spend extra time to finish the project. I had never done a formal paper before, so I am frustrated when I am doing this project. The purpose for this project is using writing, reading, and researching to introduce my academic discipline or field to the audience, also used to create and communicate knowledge in the discipline or field I was chose to explore. This project is completely different with the previous two in different aspect. This paper is basically on the research academic field, and cannot include any personal opinion in the paper. After all I think I am done for this week, I need to take a break before I finished this project.</p>
			<h1>Blog #10</h1>
			<p>This week our class got cancelled because of spring break. Yay yay yay! I really need this break to get rid of the formal research project. I was feeling so much stressed because of the researches, articles, and the interview. Although I’ve tried to work hard on it, but I really need some break at times too. </p>
			<p>Although I get to run away from school, I still have to work on my Github webpages and Codecademy. Before I enrolled into this class, I didn’t expect that we have to build our webpage on our own and learn things related to HTML. However, if it weren’t this class, I wouldn’t get to realize how I could be amazed and attracted into the process of exploring building a webpage.  I’ve learnt how to make links connect to another, how to make a new paragraph and line for my contents, and even how to create my own heading and background picture.</p>
			<p>Even though I decided to take a break from the formal research paper, but I chose to work on what I was really interested in and I don’t think that’s a bad thing! I hope I can get to learn something more that I didn’t be taught about in my CSE class through Codecademy.</p>
			<h1>Blog #11</h1>
			<p>This week is the Formal research project due. I spent most of time to do this project, also  I need to do lot of research to finish my project, I spent almost three weeks to complete the project and find out different kind of idea for my academic discipline, which is hospitality business. I needed to collect all the research work and combine to a formal research project, also the project is require 3000 words which is almost for me to type out all the words, but in the end, I finished in time. This project require a web version which is similar to the pervious project, I used the same technique I used what I learn on the previous project and upload it from the “Github” too. After I done this project, I cannot believe what I just complete, also I think this project help us to develop our research skill, which is useful in our future college academic progress.</p>
			<h1>Blog #12</h1>
			<p>This week we got the Multimedia Remix Project, I personally think this one is the best one and completely different with other project. In this project,  everyone separates into a different group and we need to film a video to present what we done which is based on Lived Experiences Report, Cultural Analysis Proposal, or Formal Research Report by someone in the group. My group chooses Lived Experiences Report, which is the stereotypes of Asians and their culture to become our issue, so the video should be detailing a personal narrative of linguistic and technological literacy. This project is mainly making a documentary about what we wrote before, so we can have chance to see what we have done and to see where we can improve from previously. That was quite interesting and excited after we plan out the idea and will start filming next week. </p>
			<h1>Blog #13</h1>
			<p>Last week after we’ve been introduced to the Remix project, although our group didn’t really have a nice start because we couldn’t decide what to do. But after we decided to focus on the stereotypes of Americans towards Asian culture, we also agreed to meet on the following Saturday to do the interview and finish the editing. </p>
			<p>One thing that I really like about our group is the team working and coordination among us. When one of our members couldn’t come to meet to us, instead of criticize and judge her, we compromise by the rest of us filming the opening together and she works on the closing up statement on her own. This is also another thing I learned by doing this project. Although some people hate to work in a group because he doesn’t like to tell people what to do or he thinks that he could have a higher working efficiency by working on his own; but in our group, the problem was totally eliminated.</p>
			<p>I’m really glad that I could be working in such a group and I appreciate all the efforts that our members put in to!</p>
			<h1>Blog #14</h1>
			<p>This week is the last project being introduce is the course retrospective project. This project is writing what we done thought out the term and the reflection what we have learned and finished. basicallly we need to write out the provious four project which are Lived Experiences Project, the Cultural Analysis Project, the Formal Research Project, the Multimedia Remix Project, and describe what we did and learned from those project. For first one is Lived Experiences Project, we chose a technology to tell a story how this species technology influence for us to chose our major. The next one is the Cultural Analysis Project, we analysis a cultural artifact, to reconnoiter a social conflict, also how the conflict is significance on society. The third one is Formal Research Project, the first formal paper I had, also we need to research many source about our academic discipline, that led to a formal research project about my major Hospitality business. The last one is the Multimedia Remix Project. This project is divide student into groups then we have to film a documentary to show what we have done from the course. Conclude all the point I have done, is basically all about the course retrospective project.</p>
			<h1>Blog #15</h1>
			<p>This week is our final week. Although this course doesn’t require us to take a final test like other subjects, but we do have lots of things that are needed to be turn in before Tuesday midnight. </p>
			<p>First of all is the course retrospective project. This project doesn’t require us to do any researches but reflect and review and we’ve done throughout the semester. Therefore, I think in general this is quite an easy task for me to accomplish. Next, the Codecademy is not difficult for me as well. Since I’ve been taking CSE before, I found out that most of the thing require us to do on the website is somewhat similar to what I learned in CSE. Followed by it is the blog, which require us to write at least 15 entries about the reflection of this course. I didn’t feel too much pressure for accomplishing this task since it’s only asking about our own opinion.</p>
			<p>Finally, it’s the design of our website which I found to be the most interesting part in our final week. By using the HTML skills we learned on Codecademy, we can change our background picture, the color and font of our content, and even the format of our webpage. It was really fun when I was looking for the best “outfit” for my blog.
