			<h1>Other reason</h1>
			<p>One solution to solve this issue is not to produce games that is so close to reality and makes people believe that they are actually the person in the game. Many of my friends believe they are actually the character when they are playing Call of Duty. That scares me because sometimes a very nice person turns into this scary person that I don't really know when he started playing Call of Duty. It's like there is another personality in his body that comes out when he goes into Call of Duty. That is why I think perhaps setting harsher restriction on gaming or just not creating them at all could really help the society in this matter. 
	I think the outcome of this issue could go two ways. One of the ways could go really bad, because most teenagers and children can't stay away from computer and games for a long time. There are actually many gamers in the society that would fight back if Call of Duty becomes illegal or no more similar games come out for them to play. Many citizens will be unhappy with taking their rights to bare firearms. However in the long run, I believe this will work out. It will reduce the amount of gunfire shooting that is been going on in the United States. Reducing the amount of games played could really help teenagers and children be less exposed to violence. The less violence that children are exposed to, the less violent they will grow up to be. People learn from examples and if there are no examples to learn from, it is more unlikely for one to cause danger.
