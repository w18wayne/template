		<h1>Communication is the most efficient way to improve the world. </h1>
		<p>Communication let people to control the world economic. Why can communication control the world? In the year 1973, Martin Cooper invented the mobile phone. During that time, sharing information was not an easy task and it took a long period of time. As cellphones became more and more popularize, it made the world a better and more efficiency place. Nowadays, cellphone become the fundamental need to every job.</p>
		<p>Nowadays, everyone have a cell phone in his or her pockets, especially the iPhone.  Steve Jobs created the first IOS system enabling the iPhones to be produced, which is very important to our society now. He represented the new age of Apple. He created apple and at first no one was really buying the apple products. However due to his successful marketing, things began to change and people started to buy more and more apple products. This led to the creation of iPhone and thus made the world more advanced, more efficient and more convenient. It could help us monitor our live in various ways. We could grab information through our phone and we could also save lots of data on our phone. It was like a moving USB thus we could do many things with the iPhone and that’s how it made our lives better. </p>
		<p>The invention of cellphone revolutionized the way people used to communicate with one another, however, the improvement from the smartphones and the combination of the Internet leads to the second generation of communication. There are several communication applications on smartphones that people cannot live without. Those instant chat apps bring out the alternative methods. For example, Wechat, which is one of the smartphone application designed by QQ Company, allows people to leave the voice message just like the text message. This application is getting more completed and innovated. Wechat could only provide the text message just like the cellphones did in few years ago, but throughout the improvement of the technology and its implication, voice message became plausible. Moreover, Wechat can be treated as the median for group chatting now.</p>
		<p>Cell phones had been invented a lot of years ago, but the engineers are still trying out various new technologies to improve cell phones. They came up with different APPs to satisfy the desire of different people. Each different APP have different uses and functions. APPs can be separated into many of different catogaries like business, education, entertainment, finance, health fames, lifestyle, and so on. The most common APP I use is BofA. This Bofa is the Bank of America APP, It is very useful, because I can see how much money I have left in my bank account, and I can also transfer money easily. </p>
		<p>Nowadays cell phones have already merged into our society. Cell phone reduces the communication time among people. Before the invention of the modern cell phone technology, letters, telegrams or beepers are the major communication tools that help us to transmit information without facing others. However, those tools require response time after one received the message. On the other hand, phone calls can easily eliminate the response time. The instant talk phone call can also solve problem in a simpler way. For instance, back in my father’s generation beeper was the most fashion thing that everyone wants to have but beeper cannot explain the message clearly. On the contrary, phone can let people explain things they want to say and to make sure their listener understand the point.</p>
		<p>Although the history of cell phones was not long, the development was very rapid. At the beginning when mobile phones appear, it could only call and answer phone calls. As more time passes, more and more functions had been added into cell phones, such as taking photo, playing game, texting other people and to be on the internet. The most useful system I like is surfing the Internet. Nowadays, Internet has become indispensable. The most of people use the Internet to check the email, communicate with others and search for information. Before the smart phone has been invented, the only way to get on the Internet was using computer, but now we can use phones to get on the Internet. When I am outside, I can use smart phone for searching, communicating and checking the email. Today, I have the WRA class but our professor was sick and he sent an email to cancel the class. If I did not use my smart phone to check my email, I possible will go to the class and wait our professor. Luckily, I check email on my phone, so I did not go to class today.</p>
		<p>Most of the job nowadays requires people to use cell phone to contact with others, they need cellphone to introduce their product and send their information. When I was an internship in a country club in Shanghai, I called lots of phone calls to club members to introduce our event. Not all the members will look the events by themselves, so we need to call them to tell they about our events. On the other hand, cellphone can also use phone to sell their product, like housing agent, they need call to the guest to ask will they want to sell their house. Most of the time, guest will reject, but if in the 1000 calls, one of their guest want to sell house, they will makes lot of money. Cellphone are help lot of people get the job and making money.
There is no doubt that cell phones can bring a lot of advantages to people. However, people will very much rely on phones. When people feel embarrassed during any events like dinners or parties, they will start to use cell phones. It will let the party become dreary. Overall, cell phones not only bring benefit to people, but also let the people loose communication skill with one another face to face. Now, lots of people only know how to use phones to chat with others. They are loosing the skills of talking face to face in person. I think people should use the cellphone in the right way.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, cell phones are gradually merging into everyone’s lives.  With the help of our cell phones, we can easily commutate with other people, search for information and also kill time. Before cell phones was popularize, people use telegraph to send out messages and as more and more people uses cell phones, we can get any information immediately as it happened. Overall, cell phones make the world a better and more efficient place.</p>
