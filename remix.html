		<p>My documentary will show this in action by exploring the data and studied performed that show the connection and claims that video games can contribute to violence. The main conflict is between: Teenagers and their virtual world and reality. Ultimately, I want the audience to feel: Sympathy and to understand the consequences of youths and their emotional disturbances from violent actions. And to understand that: People can become violent from the actions and play of video games. </p>
		<p>The activity is: Playing violent video games for several hours and witnessing the effects on people. The conflict it evidences is the violence on random or targeted people. The expected structure of events is videos from CBS, Reports from News Stations, and studies from Universities and private companies. The sequences should contribute the display of violence in youths, teens, and even adults from the continued effect of shooter person games. Facts the audiences gathers: Stats about usage and dangers surrounding violence games, that anyone can be in danger at any time from someone else or yourself. Key, important imagery:  Re-enactments and video from historical events. </p>
		<p>First we will be starting with the narrating our topic. It will contain the main issues that we have in our society. The information about the problem will be listed as a narrating and interviews of our opinions. We will also give simulation that teenager could potentially have and the out come of the result. By show all of this, we want to explain the seriousness of how much computer and video games could affect teenager’s lives. </p>
		<p>I imagine the documentary will end with a conclusion on all that was discussed and I would like the ending to accomplish a clear goal for parents and anyone who can be affected by the aftermaths of violent games.  Any intended ending with the documentaries beginning will be very similar. We hope to accomplish many influences and to help save lives.  The influence will be to inform those involved and to help protect those at risk. </p>
