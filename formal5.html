			<p>“On average, waiters and waitress makes $7.14 an hour, and tips usually makes up most of waiters income.” (snagajob) Now there comes an issue of people not tipping enough. “My average pay for a shift is 10 dollars, and I work about five to six hours a shift. So I roughly make about two dollars or less every hour as my base pay. Tip is a very important income for me, without tips I would be making nothing” (Daniel Sun) As we can see waiters don’t make very much at base pay. Most of their income comes from tips. Whether we give good tips determine the amount of money that the waiter makes that day. It also gives the waiter confidence when we gives more tip. There is a common issue with international students though. In Asia tipping isn’t really part of our culture. Therefore when I first landed in America and needed to tip I really didn’t know how to tip. I still remember I didn’t tip the first meal I ate in America. I didn’t know I had to until the waiter chased out after me and I had an argument with him. These habits could lead to waiters having bad attitude for the whole day. The waiter would think that they have served you good and you gave no respect for their serving which is horrible. However I think this is a two edged sword. Tipping has caused some of the waiters to become lazy. Some restaurants have tipping rules such if a table dine as five or above they are automatically charged 15% tips. This has caused some waiters to become lazier and lazier towards that table and I don’t think that is fair. As I have said Tipping is an art form. “It is best for 10% at lunch and 15% for dinner at least, that is minimum acceptance for a waiter I believe for every single restaurant.” (Daniel Sun) His Words are very true, because many people tip really bad for dinners. They still tip 10% for lunch, however they do not know such as Hong Kong restaurant, because they have the same pricing for lunch and dinner, it is better to tip more. Most restaurants increase their pricing between lunch and dinner. Thus there is a lot to learn in the art of tipping. Waiters don’t make nearly enough yet they have so much tasks that they need accomplish. What are the motives behind all this hard work and great service?</p> 
	<p>Lastly, the motives of the waiters are not all about the money. “I don’t really work for money as I only have one shift at Saturday afternoon right now. I think it’s a great opportunity to meet different people from different backgrounds and getting to know some customers. I wouldn’t say I work for the customers smile, however it does make me feel accomplished to see them dining with happiness. Another reason waiter is a really fun job towards me is due to the fact I have so many colleagues that makes me motivated. They are all very hard working people and really fun to work with together. There are some inside jokes between waiters and some things that only waiters would understand. People coming from similar background would understand how waiters could have a lot of fun meeting new people and chatting with different customers to learn a lot about the world.”(Daniel Sun) As Daniel has provided the motivation is not only the money that is behind the job of the waiter. It is the happiness of the customer and the different things that one could learn at the job of the waiter. Learning different cultural backgrounds and learning everyone’s different life story is sometimes a very interesting thing for a waiter. This is yet another reason why we should tip a little bit more, because tipping gives them this motivation and stresses the point that one thought there service was good. It gives them the opportunity to continue working the way they are and have a happy mood for the whole day. That is the importance of good tipping. It is to keep the waiter steam rolling for a good service for other customers. It is also fun to make friends with waiters, because they have so many fascinating stories from the customers and they have so much to tell. They are all so outgoing and they do so many activities that are fun. I am really glad I had a friend as a waiter; he can even help me with the essay. There are more uses to waiters then just calling upon them without manner and ordering them to do things. They are not slaves, they are waiters. </p>
