			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>One of the solutions could be the ban of firearms to citizens. Although there is still black market out there selling gunfire, however I do believe restricting or abandoning the freedom to bare arms would really help this issue. There wouldn't be so much shooting around the place. I know very many people would present a negative attitude to banning firearms. However think about how many innocent citizens have died due to the right to have firearms. Many children teenagers and even adults have been victims for the right to have firearms. Many have suffered serious injuries and many have died; yet today we still do nothing about it. Yes we catch suspects and interrogate them however these things are only solving the surface of the problem. The reason people are being shot is because citizens could have the right to bare firearms. As I have mentioned previously, we do not know the behavior of the person that we are selling fire arms to. They might be a serial killer or a psycho, but we will never know. The day he erupts and tries to kill a lot of people because of his disagreements with society will be the death of many innocents. That is why firearms should really be banned out from society's reach. </p>
