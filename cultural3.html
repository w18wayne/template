			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>The first recorded usage of gunfire was in 1364. (Detective Technique Gun Timeline) In 1380, Handguns were known throughout Europe. (Detective Technique Gun Timeline) In 1540, rifles came into the pictures of firearms. (Detective Technique Gun Timeline) My point is that throughout history guns kept on evolving. Every few years, gunfire were modified for different purposes. These intentions were unknown, however they have served a negative effect on society. Throughout these evolutions more wars have erupted and the army with more sophisticated gunfire and better equipments would normally win the wars. That was why gunfire kept on evolving and became the gunfire we have in modern world. </p>
