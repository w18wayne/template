		<h1>Course Retrospctive Project</h1>
		<p>In this semester, I have taken the writing, rhetoric and American cultures 110. In the class, I wrote five projects in our class. The first essay we wrote was lived experiences project, this essay was talking about our lived experience. Second, the cultural analysis project was about cultural. Third, the formal research project, I was written about the people working experience. Fourth, The multimedia remix project, which was about game addiction and last was about course retrospective, which is I am writing about.</p>
	<p>The lived experience project was about communication is the most efficient way to improve the world. Communication let people to control the world economic. During that time, sharing information was not an easy task and it took a long period of time. As cellphones became more and more popularize, it made the world a better and more efficiency place. Nowadays, cellphone become the fundamental need to every job.</p>
	<p>Second projects we got from the class were the cultural analysis proposal. This propose to this project is through the analysis of a cultural artifact, to reconnoiter a social conflict, also how the conflict is significance on society. There are many cultural artifact that can be discuss, such as a video game, a music video, a movie, and a TV show.  I chose how video game can influence many teenagers are obsessed with playing video games. They play twenty-four hours a days, never getting any rest. After that, Teenagers started to get un healthy and mess up their life. the social issue growing up larger in scope every day, also has become a common and serious problem for most of American family. Therefore, I came out two solutions, which can help teenager to stay away from the video game, conclude my suggestions specifically is targeting gamers that stay at home and just do nothing all day but play games. Due to the fact that this has not only not improved their life but have made it worse. That is why I think games should be set to certain ages and certain groups of people. At the end, I think Video gaming has been a culture or human and hope teenager wont be obsessed on it for every moment, and become a more successful person. This project require large amount of word to develop the our point of view, which is 1800 word court for the minimum. Not similar to the previous project is that we need to find source how this culture artifact going to influence society, that was a different experiment for me to write a paper like this one. This project also require web version and use “Github” as a web page development website to finish my web pages. In this project, I need to have different template to display different part of my proposal that was have large difference with the previous one. We need to type out some HTML language to finish this web page. It was a big challenge for me to complete culture analysis proposal. </p>
	<p>The cultural analysis proposal was about Guns have become more and more advance and with limited range before. Modern day technology has improved so much compared to the past. Right now the power of gunfire cannot be underestimated as it has good precision and strength. I know that thinking that the world could be a peaceful place is merely impossible because their will always be different opinions. Firearms are dangerous and should not be entrusted to citizens. These weapons are dangerous and life threatening to innocent people.</p>
  <p>The formal research paper was about waiter, waiter is a rough job. Their income depends on other people’s gratuity towards them and they have such a hard working ethic and also a very well rounded skill set, yet they are seemed as one of the most less respected jobs globally. By written, can let people know about waiter is the job that do not have much money but can let people learn a lot.</p>
	<p>The multimedia remix project, our groups wrote about the game addiction. For the game addiction we take about how did the gamer opinion and my friends opinion. The purpose was about let people there was positive and negative attitude about this. People will get kill or release the pressure in the game. Game will be affected human a lot.</p>
