			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>Another issue I have with guns is "in game guns". That means games like "Call of Duty" has negative effects on children or teenagers. Although they have age limits to purchase the game, however adults could always buy it for their children. Not a lot of adults are aware of the serious issue that gaming has been causing. I have a few friends that like to play Call of Duty. When I ask them why do they like to play Call of Duty, they would reply me it's a pressure reliever. When I ask how it relieves pressure, they would reply taking a gun and head-shooting people was very pleasing and relaxing. This makes me see through that games were having negative effects on teenagers. My friends are all college students. They still think killing people is relieving and releasing stress. This shocked me deeply because Taiwanese people don't teach people to kill. While growing up, my parents would never let me play any violent games, because they are scared of the negative effects that could be caused by those games. After I came to the United States I clearly see the reasoning behind that. 
However humans are trained to solve problems. There are many ways that we can solve the issue at hand.</p>
