			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>Throughout our daily lives we make contact with various people. They might be our friends, our family, and our roommates. However sometimes there are people that we don’t think about but we meet maybe the most often. Every time we step into a restaurant, there will always be people welcoming us and serving us. The job of the waiter is tough and most of us meet waiters’ everyday if we decided to dine out. The function of a waiter is to serve the customer that walks through the restaurant door. What is the definition of function? The function varies throughout different restaurants. Waiters might have describe the menu for the customer, and then order the drinks and foods for the customers, serving the food to the customers and then checking back with them how the food was. After all this complicated tasks they have to serve the check and clean the tables and that’s how one table is done. (Hcareers) However every customer has different expectations. What does it mean to serve a customer? What does it mean to serve in the right way? There are various possibilities that could come to answer those questions. However there is one thing on my mind. Are customers always right? Is everything customers say always right? There have been various cases where it is seen that customers giving bad tips to waiters, although they didn’t do anything wrong. What will be the cause of this bad tipping? And how will this affect the waiter’s position? There are various questions that had to be answered about waiters. Waiter is a very interesting job and perhaps one of the toughest jobs also. The skill required to become a waiter is massive and the pressure that one has to intake is not to be unforeseen as well. Throughout this paper, we will investigate the hardship of waiters and what some of the waiter’s actually thought about their job. We will learn whether this job is really as easy as some of us think it is or whether it is a very tough job to be at. Although there is no one right answer, however my personal beliefs before researching this paper was that waiter’s have a lot of skills, however I did not think their job was tough. </p>
